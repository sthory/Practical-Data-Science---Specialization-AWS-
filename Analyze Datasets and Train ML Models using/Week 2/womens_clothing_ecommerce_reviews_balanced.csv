-1,Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately  none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;),Blouses
-1,I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.,Blouses
-1,This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down  because of the eyelet and the cute hem  it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.,Blouses
-1,I returned this item. it was soft. very blah fabric. nothing special.,Blouses
-1,"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer  but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest  but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10""  140#  34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted  and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",Blouses
-1,I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small  especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately  the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.,Blouses
-1,"This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.  i'm busty  but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered  so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't",Blouses
-1,This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot  it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.,Blouses
-1,I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side  it's gorgeous.,Blouses
0,A beautiful blouse;however  i assumed from the photo that it had a lining. it does not and the blouse is very sheer. it seems to run a bit small also  and if i add a camisole it might be too tight. the length is adequate. i may be returning it although it is very lovely and feminine.,Blouses
0,I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful  but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short  but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it  i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size  and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still,Blouses
0,This shirt was strange. the bow tie was too thin and the dots were too dominant on the shirt. it looks okay in the model picture  but when i tried it on the bow and the dots just clashed.,Blouses
0,The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty  but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest  it was very unflattering.,Blouses
0,"My review of the pros : 1) quality made  not see through in any way  can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look""  really liked it. my review of the cons  which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2""  36 small c  broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs  which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2"")  this a a",Blouses
0,This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.,Blouses
0,The fit is a little bit odd  it is short and wide  too much fabric. the quality is not good  the buttons can easily break and the stitching was falling apart. i am returning it.,Blouses
0,I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer  unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this  and in my mind  that defeats the purpose of a lightweight  sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.,Blouses
0,This shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free. i also love that it's the perfect weight and not too low cut  and that the buttons are covered. however  the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it! i didn't even wash the shirt yet. sadly  i don't think i can recommend this shirt  though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one. oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body  but it still looks great. i hope this helps!,Blouses
1,Love this crinkle cotton top for spring. the print is great and i can't wait to wear it!,Blouses
1,I love how feminine and interesting this top is. what i especially like is that you can layer different colored camis underneath to get a completely different look. the weight of the material makes it appropriate for all seasons. it is very well made and is something you can wear to work and also wear if you are going out afterward.,Blouses
1,This is a great looking top in person. i've worn this with jeans or skirts for different looks and it's cute both ways. i would order a size up though as it is not a flexible fabric so the shoulders/chest area need a little room to move comfortably.,Blouses
1,This top is beautifully detailed   it is flattering and i am very happy with my purchase!,Blouses
1,"I got this top in navy and i love it. it's loose and flowy and comfortable  yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4""  125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit  and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend.",Blouses
1,This top is absolutely gorgeous! it fits true to size to slightly large. i'd say size down if you are between sizes. it has a nice weight to it - not too heavy  but for a winter season top - it is not too thin. colors are as pictured. i can pair this with black pants or with skinny jeans. it is a top that i will wear for years to come.,Blouses
1,I love this blouse. i debated because of the cost. but this is a top i will wear forever. i have not found any of the issues other reviewers have. fit fine in the arms and the length was perfect and i have a long torso. i wear it with a nude bra and i don't have any problems with its being see through. i wore it to a party the other day and received several compliments. i was also stopped in the store and asked where i got it. it looks expensive and special. i worn it with jean  black jeans and,Blouses
1,"I bought this cute ruffled tank in ivory to go with a silk wrap skirt i've had. it arrived today and it fits perfect. i am 5'5""  125 lbs and small busted 34b. i bought size small after reading the reviews and glad i did because it fits perfect. the straps are not too long (a common problem for me)  it's a nice length  nipped a bit a bit at the waist with slight flare below. also it does not gap under the arms which is much appreciated. a lot of thought went into this little top. i can wear it to",Blouses
1,The look is frest  crisp with a touch of romance. very retailer!,Blouses
-1,I have always bought interesting  pretty  wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer. now the dresses are just retro funky. sad to see.,Dresses
-1,Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.,Dresses
-1,I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one  one side hung longer than the other  and on all 3  the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot,Dresses
-1,I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.,Dresses
-1,The dress is too loose and runs too big,Dresses
-1,"I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7"" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high  above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty  easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s",Dresses
-1,I'm so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box  but when i started to unbutton it to try it on  two buttons split in half! it's going right back.,Dresses
-1,This dress just fits weird. maybe it works for somebody..... there is a reason it has been put on sale...,Dresses
-1,"No  no  no...i don't know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging  or what  but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down. i'm 5'7""  about 145  32c  usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. this thing barely buttoned over my bust  and then flares out to a tent-like triangular shape at the bottom. i don't think it would come out by washing and ironing it; i'm afraid it was just cut poorly. i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes  unfortunately. i bought three different dresses in the",Dresses
0,This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however  there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses  but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.,Dresses
0,I ordered this dress and have sent it back. i think it could be a flattering dress; the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly. i am very long waisted  so this might just be a problem for me. i ordered regular size 2.,Dresses
0,I really wanted to love this dress  but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless  but it didn't work for this short ,Dresses
0,"I really had high hopes for this dress. i had several issues with it  though based on the high ratings other customers did not experience the same problems.   1- it was to short. i am 5'8"" and it was really really short on me. i could not sit down in it.   2- i found that it ran large. i've lost some weight recently  so perhaps i've gone down a size  but the medium was like a sack on me.   3-the waist was really roomy. it ballooned out to the point that it was comical.   4- as others have noted ",Dresses
0,I ordered this in a small petite. with tracy reese i never really know what to expect in terms of sizing. i'm 5 ft tall about 118 pounds. i'm in between a 4 petite and a 6 petite depending on the brand  broad shouldered  slim hipped and very short waisted. i found this dress to fit a little large. it was quite shapeless on me though i did like the wide scoop neck.  i'm sending this back sadly. quality is nice  though a bit thin for winter time.,Dresses
0,"I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1"" and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as ""runs large"" because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo",Dresses
0,"This is one of those dresses that is just ""nice"" and can be one that you go to in a pinch.... it flows very nicely and you can dress it up and down. it's not the best quality in fabric...but if it was all silk you would have paid 3xs. i like it  it fits well...it's not outstanding or unusual. i think it is a bit pricey for what you get...but  it's a ""work horse"" dress...it will do you right whenever you need it to!",Dresses
0,I agree with the other two reviews. it is so disappointing that this adorable dress isn't lined. the fabric is paper thin! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy. i sized down to a petite xs. i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it. i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size.,Dresses
0,Tried this dress on today in the store. i am a size 10  sometimes a size 8. the size 12 was the first size i tried that zipped all the way up. however it was still very tight around my stomach and bust. and then from having to size up  it flared out too much at the bottom for my liking,Dresses
1,I ordered this dress online in 8 p in the orange color. the length was perfect but the dress seemed big. it was a lot of dress. so i went into the store and tried on a regular 6  but the dress was a little long. they didn&#39;t have petite in stock so they had it shipped to me and it fit perfectly! i am 5&#39;3 and 150 pounds. i don&#39;t think this dress would work if you have a big bust  i&#39;m a 36b so it fits nicely around the chest area. the length of the dress was also perfect!,Dresses
1,This dress is so lovely in person  with more muted colors than pictured which will transition nicely into fall.  the overall cut of the dress is really flattering  especially for hourglass/ pear figures.  sadly  i had to return the dress because the arms were insanely small.  i after putting the dress on  i was worried i wouldn't be able to actually get it off.  if you have teeny  tiny arms...you'll probably be okay with your regular size.  if you have any kind of muscle (or squish :))  size up.,Dresses
1,This dress is cute and comfortable. big but not too big  skimming. i usually wear a 12 pant and bought a medium and it is great. i am on the taller side and the length was great too.,Dresses
1,This is soo cute and definitely runs tts. i ordered both the 6 and the 8 and ended up keeping the 8. i absolutley love this and i think it is unique and fun! i plan to wear it on a vacation in a month.,Dresses
1,I was excited to try this dress on in person and so glad i did. it's actually really cute. the material is soft and super comfortable. the dress hits just above the knee and the tie in the front accentuates your waist. i was pleasantly surprised at how cute it really is. i'm excited to wear this to work! worth the price.,Dresses
1,The stress is a simple basic. i got it in the navy stripe and have worn it with the long gray scarf  similar to pictured. it is very soft and comfortable.,Dresses
1,Tried this lovely navy dress on in the store in a size 6 and it was perfect. wish there had been a petite available to try since the hem fell below the knees on me and it would have to be hemmed. the crisscross on the front is very flattering to the waistline and i love the see through fabric along the shoulders and back. it's stretchy too!,Dresses
1,This is a simple design  but feminine and dressy enough for a summer wedding.  this dress is great for hourglass shapes  but it does not hide your features.,Dresses
1,I absolutely love this dress. the color is beautiful  the fit is flattering and it is so comfy i didn't want to take it off until bedtime. it is an all around winner. if i could do one thing to make it absolutely perfect i would take and inch or two off the hem. i am think of doing that but seriously i am not sure i want to have it out in alterations when i could be wearing it  it is just too comfy and cute!,Dresses
-1,Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.,Fine gauge
-1,Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in. i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.,Fine gauge
-1,Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea,Fine gauge
-1,The fit was not flattering at all  but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.,Fine gauge
-1,So sad becuase i like the design. i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment. i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight. i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt.   the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve,Fine gauge
-1,I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.,Fine gauge
-1,"The color of the sweater is beautiful  but the fit was awful. it was too ""swingy"" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly  (i'm 5'1""  108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item.",Fine gauge
-1,I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance --i should have listened !,Fine gauge
-1,Bummer  i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.,Fine gauge
0,I ordered this quite nice cardigan. i received the sweater promptly (yay fast shipping!) but never received the belt to it. i tried emailing about it  but didn't get a response. the sweater really is the softest thing ever but it will not close without the belt and trying to use a different belt just doesn't work. i hope to receive the belt soon  because i'd really like to wear this a lot this winter.,Fine gauge
0,Loved the look  quality was great  but didn't work for me. too busy and off-fitting. i did return.,Fine gauge
0,This shirt is beautiful  however i thought that it was made of a softer  lighter material. it is  instead  made of a thick  heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly  i'll be returning,Fine gauge
0,I bought three of these this summer--a mint  ivory  and yellow. when i received them  they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but  then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap  outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside,Fine gauge
0,Honestly  the sweater is really beautiful...i usually buy a small in retailer tops  and this seemed to run on the smaller side. it&#39;s pretty short  but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures. it looks like i&#39;m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt. still deciding if i&#39;m going to keep it  because it is really a lovely top.,Fine gauge
0,Very boxy top  not flattering on. i will be returning.,Fine gauge
0,This sweater is great i bought the black version on sale. my complaint is the pulling factor though. you don't expect retailer sweaters to pill after a couple wears. overall i love the fit and look though so i continue to overlook it and use my sweater comb as needed!,Fine gauge
0,This is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight. however  it is an awkward length. i am tall and have a long torso so it's just not cut right for me and was not flattering.,Fine gauge
0,Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere  it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said  you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.,Fine gauge
1,Fit is true to size  color is accurate. love the feel of the knit  it's weightier than if anticipated. i'm looking forward to wearing this to my pnw trips.,Fine gauge
1,The pictures don't do this cardi justice. it's so lovely and ladylike. it's seems very well made. please can we have more from this designer??,Fine gauge
1,Caught a sale in oct and purchased the gray. beautiful light gray. i am normally a med or lg and the small in this sweater was perfect. i am larger in the bust so it is not boxy on me. added a delicate pin to the shoulder and it was darling for our casual christmas dinner.,Fine gauge

1,I love the way this fits and feels on. it is a beautiful piece and makes me happy to wear. i ordered my usual size medium and it fits well. the only con is that it is dry clean only.,Fine gauge
1,I love this top  it's design is very pretty and like nothing that i have. i think this top runs true to size  i'm usually an xs/s in tops and i went with the s for this one and it fits great. i will say that the top layer of material will snag very easily  so while wearing it you have to be very careful!!,Fine gauge
1,I adore this little sweater- the pictures don't do it justice. i'm tall  with broad shoulders and small chest- the cut and design of this sweater is so flattering. colors work with denim or any neutral  and the weight is perfect for spring or early summer.,Fine gauge
1,I love how this long sweater drapes. it's soft -feels great on - and looks fabulous over leggings or skinnys!,Fine gauge
1,"This is a great sweater. it can be worn ""wrapped"" as on the model  or open like a cardigan. it is a lighter weight knit  perfect for how warm this winter has been. i love the deep purple color. normally between a small and medium and went with the medium in this sweater.",Fine gauge
-1,Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return,Intimates
-1,The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however  the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(,Intimates
-1,"This nightgown looked so comfy and cute! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i'm 5'3"" and 150lbs. it was such a shame. size large should not just be really a medium!",Intimates
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,Intimates
-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates
-1,This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.,Intimates
-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,Intimates
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",Intimates
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin  not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished.,Intimates
1,Love this chemise. perfect blend of comfort and sexy. i bought it in pink  size small. i'm a 32d about 115 lbs and if fit perfectly  i could even probably go to an xs  but i didn't want to wait. the fabric is super soft and the color is vibrant. looks exactly like the picture. decent price.,Intimates
1,I love the look of this bra  but unfortunately it is pretty skimpy and sheer. i need a little more padding to define my shape and i wish it had modesty padding. this wasn't for me so i returned it.,Intimates

1,I do wish this came in a 30dd sizing  purchased he 32d and it fits  though the band is looser than desired. i am still keeping it. i love the back  will be great for some of my dresses ti used to wear strapless bras to wear. recommend.,Intimates
1,Love this bra! i was looking for something feminine and sexy and this is perfect. it's exactly as pictured. i was worried the material would be too delicate and fragile  but it's really durable! my only issue is that it fits a tiny bit awkwardly because of the solid material on the side  but it doesn't actually look awkward  just feels a bit odd at first. i highly recommend it if you're looking for something sweet and sexy!,Intimates
1,A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!,Intimates

1,I love panties. i love the prettiest  softest  most adore-worthy panties i can find. these are my favorite boy shorts--i can always put them on and feel pretty. no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch. im a mom and my body isn't perfect anymore  but these panties give me confidence  with perfect coverage. i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer. my only warning: wash these pretties as delicates  or the lovely lace colors will fade.,Intimates
1,I love this gown so much  i would wear it everyday if i could. it is cozy  beautiful  and feels special like an heirloom. the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft. color is much prettier than the photo picks up!!! i love this gown. my favorite  hands down.,Intimates

-1,I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall  it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!,Jackets
0,Ordered my regular size large and the fit was a snug around my hips when snapped. i didn't plan on wearing it that way so that wasn't a deal breaker for me. but because i have a larger bust i felt the padding added pounds and lots of width to my frame. i also had the same issues with coloring as other reviewers. and lastly  the collar is really high and it just bugged me. so this one went back.,Jackets
0,I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering,Jackets

0,Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs  however  i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall  it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.,Jackets
0,This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!,Jackets
0,I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p  as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015  and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p  it was much too,Jackets
0,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last",Jackets
0,This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,Jackets
1,After reading the reviews  i was hesitant to purchase  but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand  but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!,Jackets

1,I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style  it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist  just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d  135#  38-28-35.,Jackets
1,As other reviewers have pointed out  this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight  and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve  but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.,Jackets
1,A fabulous light weight jacket. love the detail and fit is perfect and comfortable. the jacket was not so interesting on the display table but once tried on it became mine and i suspect this is going to sell out. i really love the light color denim trim on the lapels. a keeper!  i purchased a medium and that is my standard size in retailer jackets.  for reference: 34 dd  and 145 pounds and 5'4 height.,Jackets

-1,I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,Jeans
-1,I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair  the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong  but those were even worse. they looked obscene.,Jeans
-1,I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips  buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then  size up.,Jeans

0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering

1,This turtleneck is already wrapped and it's soon going under the tree for me! i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on. it's fitted but not too tight or snug... just fitted and flattering. the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected. i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple - both for dress and casual.

-1,Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.,Pants
-1,These pants are the perfect color  and i love the detail of the zippered pockets... i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well. they were slightly loose  but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small. after an hour of wear  i was swimming in these! i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly  um  saggy. i am in-between a 4 and 6  and since the pants are detailed as slim fit  i thought it,Pants
0,This runs huge  not large  huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5'10  150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered  but now its just too much of a hassle,Pants
0,Ok  if i had a different body  this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband couldn't tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage)  it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me  this isn't the jumpsuit for you.     this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area (hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters).     for reference  i am 5'3 and 150 pounds. th,Pants

0,I typically wear a 4/6 but am a little bigger right now  so i went with the medium. was so excited to get these but was very disappointed when i tried them on. they look beautiful  but there is no lining  leaving the fabric uncomfortable. they were also huge! definitely make sure you size down if you d,Pants
0,The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband  mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips  they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue  i would keep the trousers  as they are comfortable and pretty  and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through  as i feared.,Pants

1,I am so happy with this jumpsuit! it is the perfect comfortable and casual summer outfit. the fabric is super soft. i was unsure about the length at first because it's shorter than my other jumpsuits  but if you scrunch up the bottom of the legs and add some sandals  it's a great look.   highly recommend!,Pants

1,Love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle...in a great way. the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters. i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them...they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again. i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests...in a contrast print would be incredible,Pants
-1,Beware. white is not white. white is more cream  off-white  light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute  but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also  the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.,Shorts
-1,Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!,Shorts
-1,I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy  but after laundering one time  the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors  but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback  but be careful with laundering.,Shorts
-1,"I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore  and 2) are ""curvy on the bottom"" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans  and like the other reviewer observed as well  i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that  but they just are",Shorts

-1,The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.,Shorts
-1,It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn't live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3  115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom  a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.,Shorts
-1,I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.,Shorts
-1,I've been wearing these shorts for years  i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure  they're great when you try them on in the store..soft  comfortable  flattering  but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times  sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall  and a,Shorts
0,I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.,Shorts
0,The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.,Shorts
0,I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great  but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look  but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable  the navy color is really pretty.,Shorts

0,There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.,Shorts

1,So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year  i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom,Shorts
1,I love these shorts! i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could. but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt. they are so comfortable and the length is perfect! i love that they are loose around the thigh so they don't ride up while walking. i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide. i wish they had black  army green  and a dark wine. i would be in heaven!! i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy.,Shorts

1,I tried on this romper when it was still full price and loved it  but wasn't sure i wanted to splurge at the time. at the new sale price this romper is definitely worth it for the quality and style. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits pretty well  but truthfully an xxs would have been better if it existed. the top part of the romper (above the waist) is a bit long--- the waistband hits maybe an inch or 2 below my natural waist  but perhaps this can be tailored. overall very happy with this purchas,Shorts
-1,I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.,Skirts
-1,I loved this skirt. so flattering and such a beautiful fabric. unfortunately after only 2 wears  the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me (literally). i bought the right size and it was not too tight. the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly. very disappointing.,Skirts
-1,This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length)  it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length  which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.,Skirts
-1,This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move  and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also  the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow.,Skirts
-1,The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it  and was mostly white  yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.,Skirts
-1,What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt  and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes  i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.,Skirts
-1,As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price,Skirts
-1,I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.,Skirts
-1,This was disappointing to me. i love how this looks on the model. unfortunately it made me look huge. it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on. i didn't find it was tts  i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist. before i'd even put it on  i noticed the waist looked very small. i don't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching. it's like the buttons didn't match up or something.,Skirts

0,"The fabric was more ""southwestern"" looking when i got it than it looked in the pics. it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like.",Skirts
0,This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other  giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.,Skirts
0,The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.,Skirts
0,I absolutely adore this skirt! sadly it was a lot of skirt for me- i'm 5 feet nothing and it would have been too much fabric to hem. wish this skirt came in a petite size. great color and a fun option for the fall wedding season!,Skirts

0,The material is beautiful and as others said its a bit fuller than one might think. i am returning because it's high waisted with a thick elastic waist band. not my style - i suppose it would work with a thick belt. as i said its beautiful - just not my style.,Skirts
1,Just grabbed this today! great find. i paired it with a white blouse with blue polka dots....will pair with anything though  with great neutral colors. white or blue jean jackets  sweaters....the skirt has a little stretch for my hourglass figure  but would work with any type body i think. a many season skirt  perfect for traveling.,Skirts
1,I decided to go shopping at my local co store and as soon as i walked in  i saw this skirt but it was used  as a top with green cropped summery pants on a mannequin. one of the lovely salesgirls decided she liked it better that way after she tried it as a top herself.  i tried it as well and love it as a top! she was small framed and my height and told me she sized up for comfort and she was correct. if used with a strapless bra  your regular size ( mine is a small) will be uncomfortable. howeve,Skirts
1,I've been wanting a higher-waisted  button-front skirt. this one was perfect because of the texture on the denim.. it makes it dressy enough to wear to work if you are in a business-casual setting. i think it has a ton of versatility for multiple seasons. i'm normally a 0 or 2 in dresses (5'6  118 lbs) and i ordered a 0 in the skirt  as the natural waist is a little on the large side. i love it!,Skirts
1,Based on the two reviews on this skirt and  for the sale price i purchased the small--i 'm usually a large/extra large. i carry my weight in the middle  and this skirt stills works. very sofisticated striping  slimming! i haven't experienced any slipping  but i haven't worn it for any great length of time yet. there are numerous ways to create chic looks.,Skirts
1,This skirt is fabulous!!! i ordered it in both grey and green. only flaw was the grey one was 2 inches shorter all the way around (made it too short!!!)  so i kept the green. great for summer and maybe fall with flats and a jacket.,Skirts
1,Fits just like on the model  even though im 5'4''. really happy with this casual summer find.,Skirts
1,I really like this skirt - so colorful! the interesting pattern and multiple colors will make this a great fall skirt. i can wear it with pink  burgundy  gray  white  black  and probably many more. can't wait for the temps to drop!,Skirts
1,Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.,Skirts
1,I fell in love with this online and i'm so thrilled that it's even more beautiful in person. it is a stunning  very dark teal velvet with the most gorgeous embroidery. perfect fit  quality  and nicely lined. a keeper for years to come! i think it's true to size (for reference i'm 5'1  100 lbs and the 0p fits perfectly),Skirts
-1,Ordered the biggest size available  the large. the arms are so tight  i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms  either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one.,Sleep

-1,I wanted this so badly  to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am  and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.,Sleep

-1,Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.,Sleep

-1,"I ordered these in m (5'8"" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material  although comfortable  is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these  the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore  these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white  at that)  so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature",Sleep

-1,Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,Sweaters

0,I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however  the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.,Sweaters
1,This poncho is perfect! the slits on the side may seem intimidating at first  but wear a flowy tank under neath it for a nice added detail. it's easy to wear over a fitted dress as well  or a high-waisted full skirt. i have red hair and the gold looks amazing with that hair color. but the grey and creme are neutral and go well with a lot of options.,Sweaters
1,There are a lot of boiled wool sweaters and jackets available right now-this is not one of my favorites. while the color is amazing  the buttons are very cheap plastic and they look that way. the are very close together which is hard to button up. the coat is not flattering in the same way it is on the model when it is opened an requires to be closed to have an hour-glass shape. however  sizing down (which would also fix this problem) would cause the shoulder/arm area to be too tight.,Sweaters

-1,I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.,Swim
0,I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online  but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup  i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight  the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even,Swim
0,I love the way that this suit looked  however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on  that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine  but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.,Swim

1,I am very happy with this suit! it is gorgeous and very well made. my only suggestion is to use your normal swimsuit size when ordering rather than their recommendations. i am a 4-6 in dress size but am curvy with a large bust. i went with a medium because i thought there was no way i would wear a small! the medium actually fits great in the waist and bottom  however is small in the top for me. i'm ordering a large to compare coverage.,Swim
