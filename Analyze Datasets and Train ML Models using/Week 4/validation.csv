__label__-1 "what drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front . the shirt was folded at the store which makes sense because if it were hung it up fewer people would try it on . this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back . this is what bugs me about so many clothes that are made these days : they are so cheaply made so thin with cloth that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public . i ca n't wear sheer clothes"

__label__1 "love this pullover for its versatile style ( can be buttoned or unbuttoned ) and easy care look . it 's casual without looking sloppy . the weave is a bit open work and can easily complement a cami or a thicker top without making me look like a stuffed sausage . the hi-lo hem on the model shots do not look that way irl . the hem is straighter . soft nubbly texture that may snag easily . got this in red and brown but wanted the sold out green too ."
__label__-1 "i also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images . it is very thin as others have said . the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured . it is more similar to a cape or shawl design . if you ; 're looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design this is not it . i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design ."
__label__-1 "i 've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks . it is already tearing at the seams somehow . the quality of this is very poor ."
__label__1 "really nice green blend of colors . fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum . i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket . is a bit itchy . need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath ."

__label__-1 "this is a really nice quality dress . it is a low-cut v-neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move . i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me . it 's a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel . i am petite in size ( 5 ' 0 100lbs ) . i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length . also the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd . the skirt hit right at knee height ."

__label__1 "cute and simple . nice fabric . it 's a looser fit so if you 're in between sizes i 'd recommend the smaller size"

__label__0 "i purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design . however i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit . on the model it looks nice but it was large around the torso yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit . i shall be returning it ."

__label__-1 "i purchased this shirt in white and black . the white is more ivory-isn and is a bit thin/see through . the shirts can be worn with jeans or dressed up with a skirt . i just wish it was a little more form fitting . i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric ! very comfortable as well !"

__label__0 "this dress was cute but the fit was not quite right . the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose . it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy . like other reviewers have said this dress really needs a belt to bring it together . i ended up returning it because i did n't love it ."

__label__0 "i 'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand . i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small ... and i agree . while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear it 's tight in the shoulders and chest . for the record those are 2 areas i never have problems with . i 'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest . it was also quite short on me . i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button . the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12 ."
__label__-1 "the fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy it was too flimsy the arms were too wide and overall for $ 100 this dress did n't cut the mustard . i 'm 5 ' 7 135 the dress was long enough just did n't flow very well ."
__label__-1 "this one did n't work for me . ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein . riverdeck was cute and flattering cut . this one was boxy on me and did n't work . a bit too wide so sending back ."
__label__0 "it is very sheer which is too bad because the design is super cute ."
__label__-1 "i disliked this dress . it did n't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured . i think it would work well for tall thin women with a smaller chest . i am petite with a larger chest and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time . not recommended for petite women ."
__label__-1 "the fit was not flattering at all but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these because of the side zipper but they zip in front even though the order listing and bag label called them wine side zip pants . they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material . what bothers me is that i was charged $ 5.95 to send them back even though the product description ( and the name before someone changed it on the website ) were wrong ."
__label__1 "i ordered down a size based on other reviews . i am 5 ' tall 110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit . i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors . my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone ."

__label__0 "i can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow . this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me . perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5 ? 3 . or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me . i did size down as reviewers suggested . maybe one size was not enough : - ) . i must return it ."
__label__1 "this vest is adorable ! i love the color it goes well with almost anything . the drawstrings work great some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look . honestly i wear it at least once a week - out with friends or even to my job as a nanny . i was a little worried about the length of it because i 'm tall but it works perfectly with my build ."
__label__-1 "i love maeve but this shirt 's quality was poor and it was not worth the price . i would not recommend buying this online . you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not ...... and in my case this is being sent back ."
__label__0 "i purchased this dress online and it just did n't fit my body very well . it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i ca n't say that i 'm impressed with the quality . there were other areas too where was a loose thread which i 'm sure will develop into another hole eventually . returned ."

__label__1 "this top is comfort wear or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work . because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer . that said it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it . i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable"

__label__0 "while the cut drape and shape of this dress are very attractive seeing the fabric in person was disappointing to me . it 's clearly well-made and there are abundant high-quality details . however the combination of a large-ish pattern and the wrinkly thin cotton still felt kind of limp and cheap . i sent it back ."

__label__-1 "i loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress . unfortunately this dress missed the mark . in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white . well it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink ! bright baby pink ! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink . huge disappointment . my other issue is with the length of this dress . the description says that the"
__label__1 "i love this top . i purchased it in an xs and feels it is tts . it can be dressed up or down . i recently paired this with the cloth and stone chambray drawstring shorts and it was the perfect summer outfit . the button details in the back are such a nice touch . i got many compliments on this top ."
__label__0 "the top is huge ! i wear an xs and am not the bustiest of women but the top part of this romper felt like it belonged on a medium or large even though the bottoms and waist fit perfectly . i was really disappointed as i loved it in every other way ."
__label__1 "i love love love the fit in the corduroy so thought about grabbing these jeans as well . they fit much pretty well just the color was n't quite right . i 'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans and these do n't quite match the coloring in the photo . still debating whether to keep them . love the cuff styling and straight leg fit !"
__label__0 "i desperately wanted this to work - it 's a beautiful color and overall quality ... it is just so short and wide ( almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat ) . i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side but on my 5 ' 7 frame and long torso it just did n't look right . few extra inches and this could have been awesome !"
__label__0 "i really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy . it 's shorter in the front and longer in the back . the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled . it 's definitely worth trying on but did n't fit me ."
__label__1 "i was very hesitant to purchase this with such a high price tag but i just received it in the mail and it is absolutely beautiful . feels and looks high quality and i ca n't wait to pair it with the top the model is wearing in the photos . definitely worth it !"

__label__0 "i really wanted to love this top . love the mix of fabrics and patterns . but it is too short for a tunic length . i should have paid attention to other reviews . i 'm about 5 ' 8 '' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length is n't right ."
__label__0 "for some reason the cream colored cords are sheer . the material is quite thin . you can see the pockets through them as well as the seams . i have other ag cords and it seems the material they are using this go around is substandard . too bad ."
__label__1 "i adore the tiny brand blouses ! this one is lovely and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy embroidered material very pretty indeed . this probably is equally stunning in the nude color but it does n't show well somehow online . the navy is certainly amazing and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans . i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off . the large fits me perfectly although i am a medium in most all other tops . 5.1 130 # 3"
__label__0 "probably should have returned this but it 's just so pretty . i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it 's extremely long . tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length ? aside from that it is beautiful . the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues gold neutrals . hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt . great buy-i just wonder how i 'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter ' ."
__label__0 "i was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model ! however when i put the dress on there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton . i ordered the 0p and i am 5 ' 4 110lbs . maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top ."
__label__-1 "i had such high hopes for this shirt ! i got it in both the black and moss ( which is a beautiful color ) . however the ruffle was just too big . i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown . it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves but on me it was not flattering at all ."
__label__0 "at 5 ' 5 ( almost ) 122lbs . i always wear a size small . however this dress runs large ( no i am not smaller than i was 6 months ago ) and it looked like a dumpy sack on me . too bad i really wanted it to fit ! it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated and would be an excellent travel dress . i may try the xs . . ."
__label__-1 "beautiful fabric ! unfortunately i had to return it . after just one wear it had pills all over the side . fabric is too delicate . sad to return !"
__label__-1 "yikes ! quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool . the color was beautiful but the sweater is enormous ! strange fit under the arms as well . this one went back the same day ."
__label__0 "i bought these for a trip to the caribbean . i sweat a lot . if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color . this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat . i will spare you the photos ."
__label__1 "this is my favorite shirt to wear around the house . it 's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice i 'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood . the fabric is thin but is n't too delicate and it 's not sheer which makes it a great summer lounge shirt . the cut is flattering and the back does n't show my bra which too many of this design do . it is a bit large you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan . unfortunately however i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach . the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger . the quality seemed okay but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long ."
__label__0 "lovely jeans love the details in the cuff bottoms . the front of the jeans the relaxed boyfriend part was just too relaxed for me - too much material there that it was unflattering . otherwise cute ."

__label__1 "i am a shopper .... i shop a lot . this is one of my favorite dresses of all time ! so unique and as others have said like a piece of art ! the fit is tight through the middle but that 's what makes it look so perfect . i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike . i love it !"
__label__0 "i was disappointed in this bordeaux top a brand i usually enjoy . i ordered a medium my usual size in their tops . it was very very big and did not fit at all as pictured here . also the fabric is somewhat sheer and while i tried it on wearing a darker bra the combo of being way too large and a bit sheer was enough for me to return it ."
__label__-1 "just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite . the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift . and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely . i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting . i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this but mind the size of the slip in the petites range and also it is aqua ."
__label__1 "love this dress so much ! i bought the cranberry color first and i loved it so much that i also bought it in black . i think it runs fairly true to size . i am 5 ' 3 and about 110 and the xs petite fit perfectly . i tried the xs and it was pretty large on my frame . i love the fabric and flow of this dress and i love the pockets ."
__label__1 "this jumpsuit is cuter than it looks online . my store displayed it with a brown belt which dresses it up . it is perfect for our hot summers with brown or silver sandals . i will wear it with a short sleeve white cotton tee . i 'm 5 ' 7 and bought the extra small . pricey but worth it so stylish . so retailer !"
__label__1 "i ordered this dress online and did n't really know what to expect . but to my surprise it 's exactly what i had hoped it would be . the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern interesting print . the fabric does seem thin for the price . but i am not returning it . it 's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends . i wear it with beige sandals and the gray and beige look good together too ."
__label__0 "this top had potential but the cut is very boxy and not fitted at all like the front picture shows . the picture from the back is much more representative of what it looks like . i 'm 5 ' 7 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s and the xs in this was still huge and boxy but very short with tight sleeves ( i have small arms so hardly ever have an issue with tight sleeves ) . the small fit better as far as length and and sleeves but still very boxy . the pattern and cutouts are very cute but thi"

__label__0 "like the idea of this shirt so much . but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible . wishing the under layer really covered as no way i 'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt . might just be my body type so might work for someone else but sending back ."
__label__1 "i really like this dress a lot . the material is soft and comfortable . it is clingy but not in a bad way . the design can camouflage some figure problems . i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beige/pink belt which worked great . ca n't say enough about how comfortable this dress is ."
__label__1 "i love the fabric since it 's fall was n't expecting it to be light . but its not heavy either . just the right balance . this is one of those classics . i love the collage like pattern of the fabric . the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots . ( dressed up or down ) ."
__label__1 "for cat lovers in particular these socks will grab your attention . they are fine quality ankle socks . the kittens are really more moss green than beige ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this coat so bad . the material is lovely and it 's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off . if you have any hips forget it ( my hips are 38 ) - you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy . the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders .... like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted it was weird . but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it was n't a size thing . i bought a size medium at 5 ' 5 and 140 pounds ."
__label__1 "absolutely love this top ! i 've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top something that 'd be ideal for summertime . this beautiful piece does n't disappoint . the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning . not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have . highly recommend ."
__label__0 "simple cotton garment such that the price seems high . if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress but my normal size 6 was a bit large and even though it was size petite also to long in the upper body . perhaps a 4 p would have fit but it may have then been too small . puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body . love this shape dress and the color and pattern however ."

__label__1 "i love this skirt . it does run a little small i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist but still works . i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned . i 've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it . i also work with kids and they all love it as well ."

__label__0 "love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back . also it is a flowly top so you will need to size down . however because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms . this did n't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type ( as in not the model type ) . i am not overweight but it definitely did n't flatter my chest area . seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first ."

__label__0 "the front and back of this square sweater are the same and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it 's on backwards.the lace would be nice but it 's itchy . and the sweater is cropped so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body . the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted but the body shape is bulky . just could n't get it to work ."
__label__1 "this is soft to the touch and just beautiful . it is a little roomy but true to size . i love it that way . totally on trend for the season"
__label__1 "this is a beautiful piece -- and a really great deal on sale . it is sheer but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit !"
__label__0 "bought in white . it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear . the white is pretty sheer . will return ."
__label__0 "this is a pretty adorable jumper . the size 8 would fit someone really well who 's about a typical size 6 and maybe 5 ' 6 . i 'm 5 ' 9 and it was too short . it 's fun and definitely different . i 'd otherwise wear it ."
__label__0 "i kept this top only because i needed a plain black tank but there is nothing special about it . i found it a bit large and thin cheap material ."
__label__-1 "i am typically a small/6 in dresses but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down . it had no shape but hung like a paper sack . the armholes fit perfectly though if i had sized down they may have been too tight . i am 5 ' 6 140 lb i will return too bad because it is a pretty dress !"
__label__1 "i am obsessed with this shirt ! it 's sooooo comfy and soft like wearing a blanket ! perfect for throwing over yoga clothes . comfy yet adorable ."
__label__1 "i love this tank it is casual and comfortable but has the little scarf attached to it so sweet and styling . i tried on the xs regular and would need petite it was a bit long on me but some people may prefer that . i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looser-fit tank . both colors are nice and neutral good piece to add to a transition wardrobe .

__label__0 "i purchased the moss color in this cardigan . i really love the texture of the material . it is very very soft . my issue with this is the arms . like other reviewers have said they are extremely small ! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight . i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms ."
__label__-1 "while i love the design and shape of this blouse the fabric was of very poor quality . i will return it ."
__label__0 "i 'd hoped these would be cozy and warm . the fabric is thin and slinky . it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll . could n't wait to get them off . just horrible . and that price is very steep . ca n't recommend ."
__label__1 "this cape is stunning ! the perfect addition to any closet . it can be worn to a formal or out to dinner with jeans . the fur is so soft and the quality is superior . it has real fur hooks ( four ) to close it and the side pockets are adorable . definitely a buy and a bargain on sale !"
__label__0 "it broke my heart to have to return this dress -- the fabric is simply gorgeous very high quality and i love the contrast between the yoke and the rest of the dress . but it was simply not flattering on me . i am 5-4 with a relatively large bust and an overall medium build . the small size fit me perfectly but the cut just did n't look good on me . i have other tunic dresses that look great on me with tights and boots . so i am not entirely sure why this dress just did n't work for me . it may be tha"

__label__0 "i do n't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do . it fits a little bit weird on me and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit ( the knot is not adjustable ) . the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs so i ca n't size down . the knit is substantial so that 's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just was n't flattering on me . i had recently bought and loved lilke 's tideline pencil skirt which also has a fabric tie wrap"

__label__0 "i so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating . it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo . it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses . i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room . in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves . one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns . the lower"

__label__0 "such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful . the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist . it is however not made for the busty gal . i am a 32 dd the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest . also this dress is short waisted it is almost an empire on me . i wish it worked as it is lovely . perhaps it will work on the someone super thin ? so sad about it !"
__label__-1 "i tried this on in the store and i could n't keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds . it 's extremely itchy which is a pity because i do appreciate the design . : ("

__label__1 "when i tried on this dress my husband 's jaw dropped to the ground . it is so unique and so beautiful on . however the cut of the fabric fit oddly on me so i am exchanging for a small with fingers crossed . i am a size 6 5 ' 8 and the medium just felt a little boxy over the middle section . my six year old son said that it was the most beautiful dress he had ever seen . buy this !"
__label__0 "i love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes ( 32dd 5 ' 3 curvy ) . i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it 's so cute . i could n't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso . such a bummer !"
__label__0 "i thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me . the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me ."
__label__-1 "i ordered two sizes . when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin . both shirts were in the bag . the style is just okay . the shirt is extremely light weight . i was not impressed with the fabric . i am returning both . definitely did not think it was worth the price ."
__label__0 "nice dress you can wash it i got black in med . i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect brand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design . i wish it would be lighter material . material is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress . probably will stretch when you sit in car driving . i will be returning it for that reason too heavy for summer ."
__label__-1 "this blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great . i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest ! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions ! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side !"
__label__-1 "as much as i wanted to love this top it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am ( i 'm a size 6 ) . maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference ."

__label__-1 "i was expecting a nice golden yellow color but what i received was very dull in color with greenish undertones . very disappointed . will be returning ."
__label__1 "this is a fun dress to have in your closet ! i ordered the 4p and it was just a little to short for my taste . had the regular 4 sent and it was perfect ! i wore it the very next night to a party ... feels great and lots of fun with the bel sleeves !"
__label__-1 "how cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it ! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out . first of all the smell was unbelievable ! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that it shrunk . even though i handwashed it line dried it and pampered it to no end !"
__label__-1 "the minute i put this sweater on i could n't wait to take it off . it was way too scratchy for me . so for those with any type of sensitivity to wool this is not the sweater for you . otherwise i thought the design was quite cute ."

__label__-1 "i totally agree with the last reviewer . i 'm 5 ' 2 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders . the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i could n't move my arms . the small was better but was too big in the torso . the material itself was really nice . too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering ."
__label__0 "i 'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras so i was excited to try this one out . while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras the cups provided too much coverage for my style . if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt the top of the cup shows . bummer !"

__label__-1 "i ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy . it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear . the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions . it was n't as elegant as the model pic ( is it ever ? ) and for this price should fit like a glove . went back within seconds . also it 's pretty short and bulky short is n't flattering on too many people ."
__label__-1 "ugh the fit of this dress is terrible : / what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential . but the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok if not a tad big but hip down was crazy tight that i could n't even zip it without a ton of effort . i do n't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger . disappointing ."
__label__0 "i ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large . i am 5 ' 2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5 ' 9 like the model to wear this dress . such a shame .."

__label__-1 "i have to agree with the first reviewer ! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i could n't justify it for the price . i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well but just could n't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes ! i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews"

__label__-1 "the material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful ! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area . it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward ."
__label__1 "this is a great little top . the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts . the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching . i received several compliments when i wore it ."
__label__-1 "i was really excited about this dress- the style looked like it would be a spring/summer staple in my retailer-heavy wardrobe . i was really surprised when i received it in the mail . the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made . for the price i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better . i 've been an retailer fan for more than an decade but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f"
__label__0 "very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and could n't zip up the 8 ( am a 36c and thick/broad at the top ) as there is no give . this is also more like a fitted shirt made of lightweight muslin-like fabric . was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly air conditioned office setting so sadly it did n't work for me . could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami ."
__label__-1 "the dress is extremely high quality ! i purchased the dress in black . the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress . the dress overall is like a balloon . unless you 're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger ! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5 ' 4 . i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it 's going back : ( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference ."

__label__1 "this is such a comfy top and the fabric is really great . more supple / flowy than i expected . it does run larger than i expected . i typically wear a large and it 's almost more billowy than i would normally prefer . i would love to try a medium to see the difference but since it was purchased online i 'm just going with it . this will get lots of wear this season ."
__label__1 "i love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves . it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear . it looks like silk although it is synthetic . i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you 're done and ready for work or going out to an event . it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built"

__label__-1 "i was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up . the waist does not have elastic or any structure . the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open . the fabric is nice quality but i am returning ."
__label__1 "purchased this for new years eve and an early january wedding . ca n't say enough good things about it ! the lace fabric is soft with the perfect weight . the style is slimming and flattering . although i am short i have a full bustline and ordered regular rather than petite and it fits perfectly . pants are very easy to hem if needed . needs very little by way of accessories because the lace edging is so beautiful.4 seasons appropriate !"
__label__1 "i adore this top ! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that 's been worn for years . it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round . even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders it still works and looks just fine . i 'm broad in the shoulders and we 'll endowed but the large was perfect ."

__label__-1 "this may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried . the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo absolutely garish . the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties it just looks cheap . the skirt is an antebellum nightmare . i did not even want to try it on it 's that bad . i considered adding a photo but was too horrified . for reference i 'm 5'10 approximately the height/ size of the model but it was shorter than the photo depictes . i wanted to like it"

__label__0 "i chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure but was disappointed . the fabric is a beautiful soft fine silk but unforgiving . the cut is not truly a wrap and with a fixed thin elastic waistband was too short waisted for me . while the model looks elongated the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections ... not flattering at all . while i was drawn to the shape for my body type it may be better suited to another . happy hunting !"

__label__1 "velvet always has made quality clothing and i had purchased the same shirt in another color and i wanted to see if they had other colors they did and i got 2 more . i received in expected time and they were wrapped nicely . thank you for great choices of unique clothing ."
__label__0 "this is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it . the fit is great love the side zippers . i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed . nothing i cant get rid of ( till next time i carry a bag ! ) but if this keeps up there soon wo n't be much of a shirt left . very disappointing for the price . was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality ."
__label__-1 "the dress is really frumpy standing up . something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy maw-maw nightgown . the lace is really pretty though"
__label__1 "i ordered the cream . the fabric is unique . similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality . you definitely need a cami or tank underneath . its form fitting without being too snug . i like to wear it with distressed jeans front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle ( my trouble spot ) with chunky accessories belt necklace and a block heel . it 's a little pricey but decided worth it ."
__label__0 "the kimono is as pictured . the colors are true to what is shown on line though the description indicates green multi -- it is not green . i returned the item however . the quality is fine but it seemed extremely over-priced to me . it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality ."
__label__0 "this dress is adorable . the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer . the cotton is also nice and light . however the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips . if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you ."
__label__0 "looks nice and i did like the button detail on the collar . colors are nove and the feel is soft . i would probably have to get a petite smaller size ."
__label__1 "i love this vest . get compliments every time i wear it . it 's stretchy too : ) . unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there . so little tip do n't spill on it lol . my fault though so still 5 stars !"
__label__0 "dress is very pretty but very short almost tunic length ."
__label__-1 "it 's a cute idea but it 's so low cut and the material is very thin . i was hoping to wear it as a cool flowing summer top but i 'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it . i 'm only keeping it because it was such a good price . also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten ."
__label__1 "i love this sweatshirt . it 's super chic and sexy ( and for those of us that need actual support it looks great with a strappy sports bra ) . that said selling this as one size fits all is misleading at best . i 'm 5 ' 2 ~160 ( a lot of it muscle but i enjoy chorizo ) a 34ddd and this fit me perfectly but i ca n't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12. just be real -- this is a smedium . one star removed for the one size fits all fallacy ."
__label__-1 "material is thin with a fleece like feeling on the inside . hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material . the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward shows way too much would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath ."
__label__-1 "i thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt . not at all ! i 'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight . it is more fitted . if you are looking for something more comfy do n't buy . however if you want more of a fitted blouse feel then go for it ."
__label__-1 "i own two poodles and love anything poodle print . i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale . but it is horrible . the fit is like wearing a pillowcase . it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit . it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short wide and wrong . i was in love with the print however i had to return it ."
__label__0 "i just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words ca n't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box . i quickly tried it on . the length was perfect . but when i attempted to zip the side zipper i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest . the bodice is simply too small . sadly i have to return the dress . this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far . if you have a ver"
__label__0 "as you can see there is an array of differing opinions on here and i share sentiments on both : _______ pros : - the texture and feel of this is great ; it is very comfortable and is different . - tts for the most part ; i normally can wear sizes 10 and 12 ( m and l ) with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips . if you 're more slim/straight it 'll probably fit you like on the model . - good length not too short or too long . - the mock collar is ni"
__label__0 "i wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen . the folds on top added too much to my frame . i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes . for all others it is incredibly soft and warm . the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous ."
__label__1 "great fit and dark color ; thick yet very soft denim . only surprise for me was that the lacing is in the front ( i was expecting it to be on the sides ) but i love them anyway !"
__label__0 "the dress immediately caught my eye in the store . upon trying it on i discovered that the slip runs extremely small ( and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift ) . the skirt is a tad long -- i 'm 5 ' 6 and it hits mid-knee . it 's a shame the slip was so tight -- i loved the dress otherwise ."
